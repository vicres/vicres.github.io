As climate change increases stress, resprouting vigor is declining in many forest regions, but the underlying mechanism is poorly understood. Resprouting in woody plants is thought to be primarily limited by the availability of non-structural carbohydrate reserves (NSC), but hydraulic limitations could also be important. We conducted a multifactorial experiment with two levels of light (ambient, 2–3% of ambient) and three levels of water stress (0, 50 and 80% losses of hydraulic conductivity, PLC) on two Mediterranean oaks (Quercus ilex and Q. faginea) under a rain-out shelter (n = 360). The proportion of resprouting individuals after canopy clipping declined markedly as PLC increased for both species. NSC concentrations affected the response of Q. ilex, the species with higher leaf construction costs, and its effect depended on the PLC. The growth of resprouting individuals was largely dependent on photosynthetic rates for both species, while stored NSC availability and hydraulic limitations played minor and non-significant roles, respectively. Contrary to conventional wisdom, our results indicate that resprouting in oaks may be primarily driven by complex interactions between hydraulics and carbon sources, whereas stored NSC play a significant but secondary role.

Climatic conditions interact with local microtopography, which might either buffer or exacerbate the degree of climatic stress. Here we sought to understand how extremely dry growing seasons affected the composition and productivity of desert ephemeral communities growing in sand dunes from the Gurbantunggut desert in Central Asia, and to which extent did microtopography modulate the response. We set up a rainfall manipulation study on four sand dune microtopographies and, during two consecutive years, we measured soil moisture, nutrients and texture, ephemeral layer composition, plant phenology, biomass accumulation and biomass allocation patterns for the dominant species. We observed significant biomass reductions during the extreme drought but plant community richness and composition were not affected, indicating that the composition of the ephemeral layer in this desert ecosystem may resist under extreme conditions. Additionally, extreme drought increased biomass allocation to reproductive organs of the dominant species. There were also significant microtopographic effects as the sensitivity of biomass to drought in western aspects was larger than in eastern aspects. Our results indicate that previously overlooked microtopographical differences may mediate the impact of climate change on plant communities. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Nevertheless, automated dendrometers have not been often used to measure root-radius dynamics, their relationship with environmental variables, and the influence of endogenous processes, especially in drought-prone Mediterranean areas. Here, we measured root-radius dynamics of two coexisting oak species (the evergreen Quercus ilex and the deciduous Quercus faginea). Our goals were to describe annual, seasonal and diurnal scale root-radius patterns, and, to disentangle the role of different environmental parameters as drivers. Long-term high-resolution measurements (every 15 minutes over 7 years) were collected with automated point dendrometers on the main tree roots of five individuals per species. Root-radius annual change patterns were bimodal and similar for both oak species. Q. faginea showed three times larger root increment in the spring than Q. ilex, but the bimodal pattern was stronger in Q. ilex which showed a larger root increment in autumn. Q. faginea showed an earlier root phenological activation in the spring and in late summer compared with Q. ilex. The effects of environmental drivers across species were similar at daily scales: root-radius increased with air temperature and soil moisture and it decreased with rising vapor pressure deficit. Furthermore, daily root-radius variations for both oak species were maintained after extracting statistically the environmental effects, which points towards a significant role of endogenous drivers. These differences in root-radius change patterns at seasonal to daily scales likely result from the differences in leaf phenology and growth strategy. Q. faginea is deciduous and faster growing rate in spring than the evergreen Q. ilex, which can grow more in summer.","tags":null,"title":"Similar diurnal, seasonal and annual rhythms in radial root expansion across two coexisting Mediterranean oak species","type":"publication"},{"authors":["J.

The functional relevance of nocturnal conductance thus remains an unresolved conundrum. Here, we review and re-analyse previously published datasets on nocturnal conductance (g(n)) globally (176 species) to synthesize our current understanding on its potential biological function and to identify remaining research gaps. We found that g(n) was positively correlated with relative growth rate, which is compatible with the postulate that circadian-driven nocturnal conductance enhances predawn stomatal conductance, thereby priming stomata for photosynthesis in early daylight. The variation in g(n) across plant species and functional types was not consistent with the hypotheses that the main function of g(n) is to: remove excess CO2, which might limit growth; enhance oxygen delivery to the functional sapwood; enhance nutrient supply; or that g(n) is due to stomatal leakiness. We suggest further study regarding the potential of g(n) to be an important functional and ecological trait influencing competitive outcomes and we outline a research programme to achieve that objective.","tags":null,"title":"Assessing the potential functions of nocturnal stomatal conductance in C-3 and C-4 plants","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marta Yebra","Gianluca Scortechini","Abdulbaset Badi","Maria Eugenia Beget","Matthias M.

They can live after being harvested. In particular, the content of some essential nutraceuticals, such as carotenoids, can be altered in response to environmental or internal stimuli. Therefore, in the present study, we wondered whether endogenous rhythms continue to operate in commercial vegetables and if so, whether vegetable nutritional quality could be altered by such cycles. Our experimental model consisted of rocket leaves entrained under light/darkness cycles of 12/12 h over 3 days, and then we examined free-run oscillations for 2 days under continuous light or continuous darkness, which led to chlorophyll and carotenoid oscillations in both constant conditions. Given the importance of preserving food quality, the existence of such internal rhythms during continuous conditions may open new research perspective in nutrition science. However, while chromatographic techniques employed to determine pigment composition are accurate, they are also time-consuming and expensive. Here we propose for the first time an alternative method to estimate pigment content and the nutritional quality by the use of non-destructive and in situ optical techniques. These results are promising for nutritional quality assessments.","tags":null,"title":"Life after Harvest: Circadian Regulation in Photosynthetic Pigments of Rocket Leaves during Supermarket Storage Affects the Nutritional Quality","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Filippo Santini","Shawn C.

While traditional phenotyping techniques are costly and time-consuming, remote sensing data derived from cameras mounted on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) provide potentially valid high-throughput information for assessing morphophysiological differences among tree populations. In this work, we test for genetic variation in vegetation indices (VIs) and canopy temperature among populations of Pinus halepensis as proxies for canopy architecture, leaf area, photosynthetic pigments, photosynthetic efficiency and water use. The interpopulation associations between vegetation properties and above-ground growth (stem volume) were also assessed. Three flights (July 2016, November 2016 and May 2017) were performed in a genetic trial consisting of 56 populations covering a large part of the species range. Multispectral (visible and near infrared wavelengths), RGB (red, green, blue) and thermal images were used to estimate canopy temperature and vegetation cover (VC) and derive several VIs. Differences among populations emerged consistently across flights for VC and VIs related to leaf area, indicating genetic divergence in crown architecture. Population differences in indices related to photosynthetic pigments emerged only in May 2017 and were probably related to a contrasting phenology of needle development. Conversely, the low population differentiation for the same indices in July 2016 and November 2016 suggested weak interpopulation variation in the photosynthetic machinery of mature needles of P. halepensis. Population differences in canopy temperature found in July 2016 were indicative of variation in stomatal regulation under drought stress. Stem volume correlated with indices related to leaf area (positively) and with canopy temperature (negatively), indicating a strong influence of canopy properties and stomatal conductance on above-ground growth at the population level. Specifically, a combination of VIs and canopy temperature accounted for about 60% of population variability in stem volume of adult trees. This is the first study to propose UAV remote sensing as an effective tool for screening genetic variation in morphophysiological traits of adult forest trees.","tags":null,"title":"Using unmanned aerial vehicle-based multispectral, RGB and thermal imagery for phenotyping of forest genetic trials: A case study in Pinus halepensis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Rachael H.

Current approaches for modelling live fuel moisture content typically focus on the use of drought indices. However, these have mixed success partly because of species-specific differences in drought responses. Here we seek to understand the physiological mechanisms driving changes in live fuel moisture content, and to investigate the potential for incorporating plant physiological traits into live fuel moisture models. We measured the dynamics of leaf moisture content, access to water resources (through stable isotope analyses) and physiological traits (including leaf water potential, stomatal conductance, and cellular osmotic and elastic adjustments) across a fire season in a Mediterranean mixed forest in Catalonia, NE Spain. We found that differences in both seasonal variation and minimum values of live fuel moisture content were a function of access to water resources and plant physiological traits. Specifically, those species with the lowest minimum moisture content and largest seasonal variation in moisture (Cistus albidus: 49-137% and Rognarinus officinalis: 47-144%) were most reliant on shallow soil water and had the lowest values of predawn leaf water potential. Species with the smallest variation in live fuel moisture content (Pinus nigra: 96-116% and Quercus ilex: 56-91%) exhibited isohydric behaviour (little variation in midday leaf water potential, and relatively tight regulation of stomata in response to soil drying). Of the traits measured, predawn leaf water potential provided the strongest predictor of live fuel moisture content (R-2 = 0.63, AIC = 249), outperforming two commonly used drought indices (both with R-2 = 0.49, AIC = 258). This is the first study to explicitly link fuel moisture with plant physiology and our findings demonstrate the potential and importance of incorporating ecophysiological plant traits to investigating seasonal changes in fuel moisture and, more broadly, forest flammability.","tags":null,"title":"Physiological drought responses improve predictions of live fuel moisture dynamics in a Mediterranean forest","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Michael Dannenmann","Eugenio Diaz-Pines","Barbara Kitzler","Kristiina Karhu","Javier Tejedor","Per Ambus","Antonio Parra","Laura Sanchez-Martin","Victor Resco","David A.

While direct C and N losses caused by combustion have been comparably well established, important knowledge gaps remain on postfire N losses. Here, we quantified both direct C and N combustion losses as well as postfire gaseous losses (N2O, NO and N-2) and N leaching after a high-intensity experimental fire in an old shrubland in central Spain. Combustion losses of C and N were 9.4Mg C/ha and 129kg N/ha, respectively, representing 66% and 58% of initial aboveground vegetation and litter stocks. Moreover, fire strongly increased soil mineral N concentrations by several magnitudes to a maximum of 44kg N/ha 2months after the fire, with N largely originating from dead soil microbes. Postfire soil emissions increased from 5.4 to 10.1kg N ha(-1)year(-1) for N-2, from 1.1 to 1.9kg N ha(-1)year(-1) for NO and from 0.05 to 0.2kg N ha(-1)year(-1) for N2O. Maximal leaching losses occurred 2months after peak soil mineral N concentrations, but remained with 0.1kg N ha(-1)year(-1) of minor importance for the postfire N mass balance. N-15 stable isotope labelling revealed that 33% of the mineral N produced by fire was incorporated in stable soil N pools, while the remainder was lost. Overall, our work reveals significant postfire N losses dominated by emissions of N-2 that need to be considered when assessing fire effects on ecosystem N cycling and mass balance. We propose indirect N gas emissions factors for the first postfire year, equalling to 7.7% (N-2-N), 2.7% (NO-N) and 5.0% (N2O-N) of the direct fire combustion losses of the respective N gas species.","tags":null,"title":"Postfire nitrogen balance of Mediterranean shrublands: Direct combustion losses versus gaseous and leaching losses from the postfire soil mineral nitrogen flush","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Michael J.

We tested whether genotype leaf-scale photosynthetic and whole-tree carbon (C) allocation responses to eCO(2) were predictive of genotype biomass production responses to eCO(2). Averaged across genotypes, growth at eCO(2) increased in situ leaf net photosynthesis (Anet) (29%) and leaf starch concentrations (37%). Growth at eCO(2) reduced the maximum carboxylation capacity of Rubisco (-4%) and leaf nitrogen per unit area (Narea,-6%), but Narea calculated on a total non-structural carbohydrate-free basis was similar between treatments. Growth at eCO(2) also increased biomass production and altered C allocation by reducing leaf area ratio (-11%) and stem mass fraction (SMF,-9%), and increasing leaf mass area (18%) and leaf mass fraction (5%). Overall, we found few significant CO2 x provenance or CO2 x genotype (within provenance) interactions. However, genotypes that showed the largest increases in total dry mass at eCO(2) had larger increases in root mass fraction (with larger decreases in SMF) and photosynthetic nitrogen-use efficiency (PNUE) with CO2 enrichment.

Here we review current knowledge on how circadian regulation drives diurnal gas exchange from genes to ecosystems in the field. Molecular mechanisms underlying the structure of circadian clocks and how they regulate A and g(s), in a few model species are starting to be elucidated but additional data are required to understand regulation across phylogenies, especially within the gymnosperms, and across environments and scales. Circadian rhythms were responsible for 15-25% and for 30-35% of the daytime oscillations in A and g(s) respectively, across the C3 and C4 species for which data are available. Consequently, circadian effects over diurnal gas exchange are of similar magnitude to the effects of temperature or vapor pressure deficit. Moreover, recent findings indicate how circadian rhythms could exert significant impacts on ecosystem patterns of gas exchange, which would challenge conventional approaches to derive the environmental flux dependences. Progress in transferring laboratory findings to the field is being hampered by lack of suitable experimental and modeling facilities that can disentangle circadian effects from environmental responses in the field and in ecosystems, and methodological recommendations are offered. The effects of environmental stressors on circadian regulation of gas exchange are also poorly understood. We document how circadian control of gas exchange may be adaptive by allowing plants to anticipate highly predictable environmental cues, but also by increasing the diversity of potential gas exchange responses to environmental variation in plant populations.","tags":null,"title":"Circadian regulation of photosynthesis and transpiration from genes to ecosystems","type":"publication"},{"authors":["L.

It has been proposed that increasing atmospheric [CO2] is a major driver of broad scale woody thickening, though few field-based experiments have tested this hypothesis. Our study utilises a Free Air CO2 Enrichment experiment to examine the effect of elevated [CO2] (eCO(2)) on three mechanisms that can cause woody thickening, namely (i) woody plant recruitment, (ii) seedling growth, and (iii) post-disturbance resprouting. The study took place in a eucalypt-dominated temperate grassy woodland. Annual assessments show that juvenile woody plant recruitment occurred over the first 3 years of CO2 fumigation, though eCO(2) did not affect rates of recruitment. Manipulative experiments were established to examine the effect of eCO(2) on above-ground seedling growth using transplanted Eucalyptus tereticornis (Myrtaceae) and Hakea sericea (Proteaceae) seedlings. There was no positive effect of eCO(2) on biomass of either species following 12 months of exposure to treatments. Lignotubers (i.e., resprouting organs) of harvested E. tereticornis seedlings that were retained in situ for an additional year were used to examine resprouting response. The likelihood of resprouting and biomass of resprouts increased with lignotuber volume, which was not itself affected by eCO(2). The presence of herbaceous competitors and defoliation by invertebrates and pathogens were found to greatly reduce growth and/or resprouting response of seedlings. Our findings do not support the hypothesis that future increases in atmospheric [CO2] will, by itself, promote woody plant recruitment in eucalypt-dominated temperate grassy woodlands.","tags":null,"title":"Effects of competition and herbivory over woody seedling growth in a temperate woodland trump the effects of elevated CO2","type":"publication"},{"authors":["William R.

We assessed the climatic and biotic drivers of the seasonality of net ecosystem-atmosphere CO2 exchange (NEE) of a eucalyptus-dominated forest near Sydney, Australia, using the eddy covariance method. The climate is characterised by a mean annual precipitation of 800 mm and a mean annual temperature of 18 degrees C, hot summers and mild winters, with highly variable precipitation. In the 4-year study, the ecosystem was a sink each year (-225 g Cm-2 yr(-1) on average, with a standard deviation of 108 g Cm-2 yr(-1)); inter-annual variations were not related to meteorological conditions. Daily net C uptake was always detected during the cooler, drier winter months (June through August), while net C loss occurred during the warmer, wetter summer months (December through February). Gross primary productivity (GPP) seasonality was low, despite longer days with higher light intensity in summer, because vapour pressure deficit (D) and air temperature (T-a) restricted surface conductance during summer while winter temperatures were still high enough to support photosynthesis. Maximum GPP during ideal environmental conditions was significantly correlated with remotely sensed enhanced vegetation index (EVI; r(2) = 0.46) and with canopy leaf area index (LAI; r(2) = 0.29), which increased rapidly after mid-summer rainfall events. Ecosystem respiration (ER) was highest during summer in wet soils and lowest during winter months. ER had larger seasonal amplitude compared to GPP, and therefore drove the seasonal variation of NEE. Because summer carbon uptake may become increasingly limited by atmospheric demand and high temperature, and because ecosystem respiration could be enhanced by rising temperatures, our results suggest the potential for large-scale seasonal shifts in NEE in sclerophyll vegetation under climate change.","tags":null,"title":"Upside-down fluxes Down Under: CO2 net sink in winter and net source in summer in a temperate evergreen broadleaf forest","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Josu G.

These numerical rating systems lack the physical basis required to reliably quantify forest flammability outside the environments of their development or under novel climate conditions.

Our new additive intensity index, NInt(A), is the first of its kind, and it is generally more suitable for assessing competition and facilitation intensity than the widely used RII, which may underestimate facilitation. Our new standardized importance indices solve the main statistical problems that are known to affect C-imp and I-imp. Intensity and importance with the same symmetry should be used within the same study. The Neighbour-effect Indices, sharing the same formulation, will allow for unbiased comparisons between intensity and importance, and between types of symmetry.","tags":null,"title":"A new family of standardized and symmetric indices for measuring the intensity and importance of plant neighbour effects","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Victor Resco de Dios","Arthur Gessler","Juan Pedro Ferrio","Josu G.

Partly independent from environmental variation, molecular circadian clocks drive similar to 24 h oscillations in leaf-level photosynthesis, stomatal conductance and other physiological processes in plants under controlled laboratory conditions. If present and of sufficient magnitude at ecosystem scales, circadian regulation could lead to different results when using the bottom-up approach (where circadian regulation exerts a negligible influence over fluxes because the environment is modified rapidly) relative to the top-down approach (where circadian regulation could affect fluxes as it requires the passage of a few hours). Here we dissected the drivers of diurnal net CO2 exchange in canopies of an annual herb (bean) and of a perennial shrub (cotton) through a set of experimental manipulations to test for the importance of circadian regulation of net canopy CO2 exchange, relative to that of temperature and vapor pressure deficit, and to understand whether circadian regulation could affect the derivation of environmental flux dependencies. Contrary to conventional wisdom, we observed how circadian regulation exerted controls over net CO2 exchange that were of similar magnitude to the controls exerted by direct physiological responses to temperature and vapor pressure deficit. Diurnal patterns of net CO2 exchange could only be explained by considering effects of environmental responses combined with circadian effects. Consequently, we observed significantly different results when inferring the dependence of photosynthesis over temperature and vapor pressure deficit when using the top-down and the bottom up approaches.

Photosynthesis remained stable for plants in eCO(2) during the heatwave. Based on the effect size ratio (eCO(2):aCO(2)), g(s) and ETR were temporarily affected more by the heatwave than A. A reduction in ETR in eCO(2) was the only lasting effect of the heatwave. There were no significant differences among genotypes.

Apart from increases in the mean, warm/hot temperature extremes are expected to become more prevalent in the future, along with an increase in the frequency of droughts. It is crucial to better understand the response of terrestrial ecosystems to such temperature extremes for predicting land-surface feedbacks in a changing climate. While land-surface feedbacks in drought conditions and during heat waves have been reported from Europe and the US, direct observations of the impact of such extremes on the carbon and water cycles in Australia have been lacking. During the 2012/2013 summer, Australia experienced a record-breaking heat wave with an exceptional spatial extent that lasted for several weeks. In this study we synthesised eddy-covariance measurements from seven woodlands and one forest site across three biogeographic regions in southern Australia. These observations were combined with model results from BIOS2 (Haverd et al., 2013a, b) to investigate the effect of the summer heat wave on the carbon and water exchange of terrestrial ecosystems which are known for their resilience toward hot and dry conditions. We found that water-limited woodland and energy-limited forest ecosystems responded differently to the heat wave. During the most intense part of the heat wave, the woodlands experienced decreased latent heat flux (23% of background value), increased Bowen ratio (154 %) and reduced carbon uptake (60 %). At the same time the forest ecosystem showed increased latent heat flux (151 %), reduced Bowen ratio (19 %) and increased carbon uptake (112 %). Higher temperatures caused increased ecosystem respiration at all sites (up to 139 %). During daytime all ecosystems remained carbon sinks, but carbon uptake was reduced in magnitude. The number of hours during which the ecosystem acted as a carbon sink was also reduced, which switched the woodlands into a carbon source on a daily average. Precipitation occurred after the first, most intense part of the heat wave, and the subsequent cooler temperatures in the temperate woodlands led to recovery of the carbon sink, decreased the Bowen ratio (65 %) and hence increased evaporative cooling. Gross primary productivity in the woodlands recovered quickly with precipitation and cooler temperatures but respiration remained high. While the forest proved relatively resilient to this short-term heat extreme the response of the woodlands is the first direct evidence that the carbon sinks of large areas of Australia may not be sustainable in a future climate with an increased number, intensity and duration of heat waves.","tags":null,"title":"Carbon uptake and water use in woodlands and forests in southern Australia during an extreme heat wave event in the ``Angry Summer″ of 2012/2013","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jason Beringer","Lindsay B.

This paper describes the evolution, design, and current status of OzFlux as well as provides an overview of data processing. We analyse measurements from all sites within the Australian portion of the OzFlux network and two sites from New Zealand. The response of the Australian biomes to climate was largely consistent with global studies except that Australian systems had a lower ecosystem water-use efficiency. Australian semi-arid/arid ecosystems are important because of their huge extent (70 %) and they have evolved with common moisture limitations. We also found that Australian ecosystems had a similar radiation-use efficiency per unit leaf area compared to global values that indicates a convergence toward a similar biochemical efficiency. The two New Zealand sites represented extremes in productivity for a moist temperate climate zone, with the grazed dairy farm site having the highest GPP of any OzFlux site (2620 gC m(-2) yr(-1)) and the natural raised peat bog site having a very low GPP (820 gC m(-2) yr(-1)). The paper discusses the utility of the flux data and the synergies between flux, remote sensing, and modelling. Lastly, the paper looks ahead at the future direction of the network and concludes that there has been a substantial contribution by OzFlux, and considerable opportunities remain to further advance our understanding of ecosystem response to disturbances, including drought, fire, land-use and land-cover change, land management, and climate change, which are relevant both nationally and internationally. It is suggested that a synergistic approach is required to address all of the spatial, ecological, human, and cultural challenges of managing the delicately balanced ecosystems in Australasia.","tags":null,"title":"An introduction to the Australian and New Zealand flux tower network - OzFlux","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Victor Resco de Dios","Arthur Gessler","Juan Pedro Ferrio","Josu G.

The influence of such circadian regulation over whole-canopy fluxes remains uncertain; diurnal CO2 and H2O vapor flux dynamics in the field are currently interpreted as resulting almost exclusively from direct physiological responses to variations in light, temperature and other environmental factors. We tested whether circadian regulation would affect plant and canopy gas exchange at the Montpellier European Ecotron. Canopy and leaf-level fluxes were constantly monitored under field-like environmental conditions, and under constant environmental conditions (no variation in temperature, radiation, or other environmental cues). Results: We show direct experimental evidence at canopy scales of the circadian regulation of daytime gas exchange: 20-79 % of the daily variation range in CO2 and H2O fluxes occurred under circadian entrainment in canopies of an annual herb (bean) and of a perennial shrub (cotton). We also observed that considering circadian regulation improved performance by 8-17 % in commonly used stomatal conductance models. Conclusions: Our results show that circadian controls affect diurnal CO2 and H2O flux patterns in entire canopies in field-like conditions, and its consideration significantly improves model performance. Circadian controls act as a `memory' of the past conditions experienced by the plant, which synchronizes metabolism across entire plant canopies.","tags":null,"title":"Circadian rhythms have significant effects on leaf-to-canopy scale gas exchange under field conditions","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Most Jannatul Fardusi","Juan Pedro Ferrio","Caries Comas","Jordi Voltas","Victor Resco de Dios","Luis Serrano"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1475280000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1475280000,"objectID":"ae14b323df37d30bf0ed8057712929e5","permalink":"https://vicres.github.io/publication/isi-000385329100013/","publishdate":"2020-05-23T08:50:20.41189Z","relpermalink":"/publication/isi-000385329100013/","section":"publication","summary":"The study of intra-specific variations in growth and plant physiological response to drought is crucial to understand the potential for plant adaptation to global change.

Leaf economics and hydraulic traits strongly influence photosynthesis. While the level of coordination among these traits can differ between sets of species, leaf functional trait coordination within species remains poorly understood. Furthermore, elevated concentrations of atmospheric CO2 commonly influence the expression of leaf photosynthetic, economics and hydraulic traits in contrasting ways, yet the effect of variable concentrations of atmospheric CO2 on patterns of trait coordination within species remains largely untested. 2. We examined the relationships among key leaf photosynthetic (e. g. net photosynthesis and photosynthetic biochemistry), economics and water-use (e. g. leaf mass per unit area and stomatal conductance) and hydraulic traits (e. g. vein density) in 14 genotypes of Eucalyptus camaldulensis grown in ambient (aCO(2)) and elevated (eCO(2)) [CO2]. We examined the level of coordination among leaf traits in aCO(2) and then assessed whether growth in eCO(2) altered that coordination. 3. We found that leaf traits related to photosynthetic capacity, economics and water-use, and hydraulics were decoupled among genotypes grown in aCO(2), yet strong relationships were generally observed among suites of traits within each `functional group'. 4. Significant responses to growth in eCO(2) were observed for most leaf photosynthetic and economics and water-use traits, with the magnitude and direction of the response varying among traits. In contrast, leaf hydraulics traits were unaffected by variable growth CO2. Despite this, growth in eCO(2) did not substantially alter patterns of leaf trait coordination observed in aCO(2). 5. These results suggest suites of leaf traits associated with photosynthetic capacity, economics and water-use and hydraulics, respectively, can form independent axes of variation among genotypes of a single species, regardless of growth CO2. Although growth in eCO(2) did not substantially alter patterns of trait coordination, decoupling of leaf functional traits among genotypes may allow genetically distinct populations to produce novel combinations of traits that may be adaptive in response to changes in their local environment.","tags":null,"title":"Leaf photosynthetic, economics and hydraulic traits are decoupled among genotypes of a widespread species of eucalypt grown under ambient and elevated CO2","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Matthias M.

A wealth of studies have examined the variation in CO2 responses across tree species, but the extent of intraspecific variation in response to elevated CO2 (eCO(2)) has, so far, been examined in individual studies and syntheses of published work are currently lacking. We conducted a meta-analysis on the effects of eCO(2) on tree growth (height, stem biomass and stem volume) and photosynthesis across genotypes to examine whether there is genetic variation in growth responses to eCO(2) and to understand their dependence on photosynthesis. We additionally examined the interaction between the responses to eCO(2) and ozone (O-3), another global change agent. Most of the published studies so far have been conducted in juveniles and in Populus spp., although the patterns observed were not species dependent. All but one study reported significant genetic variation in stem biomass, and the magnitude of intraspecific variation in response to eCO(2) was similar in magnitude to previous analyses on interspecific variation. Growth at eCO(2) was predictable from growth at ambient CO2 (R(2)aEuro...=aEuro...0.60), and relative rankings of genotype performance were preserved across CO2 levels, indicating no significant interaction between genotypic and environmental effects. The growth response to eCO(2) was not correlated with the response of photosynthesis (PaEuro... aEuro...0.1), and while we observed 57.7% average increases in leaf photosynthesis, stem biomass and volume increased by 36 and 38.5%, respectively, and height only increased by 9.5%, suggesting a predominant role for carbon allocation in ultimately driving the response to eCO(2). Finally, best-performing genotypes under eCO(2) also responded better under eCO(2) and elevated O-3. Further research needs include widening the study of intraspecific variation beyond the genus Populus and examining the interaction between eCO(2) and other environmental stressors. We conclude that significant potential to foster CO2-induced productivity gains through tree breeding exists, that these programs could be based upon best-performing genotypes under ambient conditions and that they would benefit from an increased understanding on the controls of allocation.","tags":null,"title":"Intraspecific variation in juvenile tree growth under elevated CO2 alone and with O-3: a meta-analysis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Victor Resco de Dios"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1464739200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1464739200,"objectID":"61e6edf0903be93d127fb202f599fc88","permalink":"https://vicres.github.io/publication/isi-000376281100001/","publishdate":"2020-05-23T08:50:20.41527Z","relpermalink":"/publication/isi-000376281100001/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"When fire acts like an irrigation: competition release after burning enhances growth","type":"publication"},{"authors":["R.

We first compare the performance of two existing approaches to predict D from satellite observations.

One of the main uncertainties in global change predictions lies in how the spatiotemporal dynamics of forest productivity will be affected by climate warming. Here we show an increasing influence of climate on the spatial variability of tree growth during the last 120 y, ultimately leading to unprecedented temporal coherence in ring-width records over wide geographical scales (spatial synchrony). Synchrony in growth patterns across cold-constrained (central Siberia) and drought-constrained (Spain) Eurasian conifer forests have peaked in the early 21st century at subcontinental scales (similar to 1,000 km). Such enhanced synchrony is similar to that observed in trees co-occurring within a stand. In boreal forests, the combined effects of recent warming and increasing intensity of climate extremes are enhancing synchrony through an earlier start of wood formation and a stronger impact of year-to-year fluctuations of growing-season temperatures on growth. In Mediterranean forests, the impact of warming on synchrony is related mainly to an advanced onset of growth and the strengthening of drought-induced growth limitations. Spatial patterns of enhanced synchrony represent early warning signals of climate change impacts on forest ecosystems at subcontinental scales.","tags":null,"title":"Forests synchronize their growth in contrasting Eurasian regions in response to climate warming","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Victor Resco de Dios","Michael E.

Concomitantly, the adaptive value of nocturnal transpiration in C-3 plants remains unknown because it occurs without carbon assimilation. These seemingly unrelated processes are interconnected because circadian regulation drives temporal patterns in nocturnal stomatal conductance, with maximum values occurring immediately before dawn for many species. We grew individuals of six Eucalyptus camaldulensis genotypes in naturally lit glasshouses and measured sunset, predawn and midday leaf gas exchange and whole-plant biomass production. We tested whether sunrise anticipation by the circadian clock and subsequent increases in genotype predawn stomatal conductance led to rapid stomatal opening upon illumination, ultimately affecting genotype differences in carbon assimilation and growth. We observed faster stomatal responses to light inputs at sunrise in genotypes with higher predawn stomatal conductance. Moreover, early morning and midday stomatal conductance and carbon assimilation, leaf area and total plant biomass were all positively correlated with predawn stomatal conductance across genotypes. Our results lead to the novel hypothesis that genotypic variation in the circadian-regulated capacity to anticipate sunrise could be an important factor underlying intraspecific variation in tree growth.","tags":null,"title":"Genetic variation in circadian regulation of nocturnal stomatal conductance enhances carbon assimilation and growth","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Michael J.

This contrasts with physiological studies where 25% or more of water losses have been reported to occur occurring overnight at leaf and plant scales. This gap probably arose from limitations in techniques to measure nocturnal water fluxes at ecosystem scales, a gap we bridge here by using lysimeters under controlled environmental conditions. The magnitude of the nocturnal water losses (12-23% of daytime water losses) in rowcrop monocultures of bean (annual herb) and cotton (woody shrub) would be globally an order of magnitude higher than documented responses of global evapotranspiration to climate change (51-98 vs. 7-8 mm yr(-1)). Contrary to daytime responses and to conventional wisdom, nocturnal transpiration was not affected by previous radiation loads or carbon uptake, and showed a temporal pattern independent of vapour pressure deficit or temperature, because of endogenous controls on stomatal conductance via circadian regulation. Our results have important implications from largescale ecosystem modelling to crop production: homeostatic water losses justify simple empirical predictive functions, and circadian controls show a fine-tune control that minimizes water loss while potentially increasing posterior carbon uptake.","tags":null,"title":"Processes driving nocturnal transpiration and implications for estimating land evapotranspiration","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yan-Shih Lin","Belinda E.

Fires cause direct emission of greenhouse gases (GHG) such as carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O), due to the combustion of organic matter, creating a positive feedback on climate change. However, the potential importance of indirect GHG emissions due to changes in soil biological and chemical properties after fire is less well known. Increased soil mineral nitrogen (N) concentrations after fire pose a risk for increased emissions of gaseous N, but studies on the post-fire N2O production and soil N turnover rates (mineralization, nitrification, microbial immobilization, denitrification) are still rare. We determined N2O production, rates of N turnover and pathways for N2O production from the soil of burned and unburned plots of a Macchia shrubland in central Spain using a N-15 labelling approach. Measurements were initiated before the controlled burning and continued for up to half a year after fire. Fire markedly increased the risk of N2O emissions from soil through denitrification (N2O production rate was 3 to approximate to 30 times higher in burned soils compared to control, with N2O being produced solely from soil nitrate). In contrast, soil gross N cycling rates were not accelerated after fire. Thus, the increased N2O production was not closely linked with N mineralization, but may be explained by increased mineral N availability from ash, increased pH in burned plots, and less competition for available N and C sources due to absence of plants.

Seedling establishment is a critical demographic bottleneck and is considered to be alleviated by increases in water availability and negatively impacted by interactions with grasses, particularly when water stress increases. However, interactions with grasses that are not actively competing for resources ('passive interactions' when grasses are dead) has seldom been considered. Could the transition from a live to a dead grass (litter) canopy favour recruitment of woody seedlings in a semi-arid grassland of the American SW? How does the sign and intensity of grass-seedling interactions change across drastically different summer precipitation regimes with and without passive interactions? Location: Sonoran Desert shrub savanna at the Santa Rita Experimental Range, near Tucson, AZ, US. Methods: Four cohorts of Prosopis velutina seeds were planted annually (20022005) under rainout shelters that intercepted all incoming precipitation on a soil with sandy loam texture. Summer precipitation was manipulated to simulate either a 50% increase or decrease in the long-termmean, and cover was manipulated to simulate a grassland dominated by the C-4 bunchgrass Heteropogon contortus or left unvegetated. Emergence and survival of P. velutina was monitored and compared across cover types, along with monitoring of soil water content and light interception. Results: Strong active competition was observed with live grasses, under both summer drought and also under ample summer water supply. However, the pattern was reversed and strong passive facilitation of P. velutina was observed over time when grass canopies died and remained in place. This passive facilitation under dry summers was so strong that recruitment under dead grass conditions was comparable to that observed when ample water supply removed the effects of competition on unvegetated plots. Conclusions: After significant mortality of standing grass canopies, which typically compete for limited soil moisture resources, rates of recruitment by shrubs may increase even with significant seasonal drought. This work extends our understanding of interactions among co-located organisms and their effects on plant community dynamics, and introduces a new hypothesis on how grass litter facilitates woody plant encroachment during seasonal droughts.","tags":null,"title":"Transitions from grassland to savanna under drought through passive facilitation by grasses","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Dana M.

We also measured leaf gas exchange and carbon isotopic composition in L. dalmatica and the dominant native C-3 grass Pascopyrum smithii. CO2 enrichment increased L. dalmatica biomass 13-fold, seed production 32-fold, and clonal expansion seven-fold, while warming had little effect on L. dalmatica biomass or reproduction. Elevated CO2 decreased stomatal conductance in P. smithii, contributing to higher soil water, but not in L. dalmatica. Elevated CO2 also strongly increased L. dalmatica photosynthesis (87% versus 23% in P. smithii), as a result of both enhanced carbon supply and increased soil water.

Here we tested the impact of soil phosphorous (P) concentration, atmospheric CO2 concentration and air temperature on stomatal conductance (g(s)) during early and late periods in the night, as well as at midday in naturally, sun-lit glasshouse-grown Eucalyptus tereticornis Sm. seedlings. Soil P was the main driver of nocturnal g(s), which was consistently higher in low soil P (37.3-79.9 mmol m(-2) s(-1)) than in high soil P (17.7-49.3 mmol m(-2-1)). Elevated temperature had only a marginal (P = 0.07) effect on g(s) early in the night (g(s) decreased from 34.7 to 25.8 mmol m(-2) s(-1) with an increase in temperature of 4 degrees C). The effect of CO2 depended on its interaction with temperature. Stomatal conductance responses to soil P were apparently driven by indirect effects of soil P on plant anatomy, since g(s) was significantly and negatively correlated with wood density. However, the relationship of g(s) with environmental factors became weaker late in the night, relative to early in the night, likely due to apparent endogenous processes; g(s) late in the night was two times larger than g(s) observed early in the night. Time-dependent controls over nocturnal g(s) suggest that daytime stomatal models may not apply during the night, and that different types of regulation may occur even within a single night. We conclude that the enhancement of nocturnal g(s) under low soil P availability is unlikely to be adaptive in our species because of the relatively small amount of transpiration-induced mass flow that can be achieved through rates of nocturnal water loss (3-6% of daytime mass flow).","tags":null,"title":"Soil phosphorous and endogenous rhythms exert a larger impact than CO2 or temperature on nocturnal stomatal conductance in Eucalyptus tereticornis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Victor Resco de Dios","Ruben Diaz-Sierra","Michael L.

Night-time variation in d13CR_leaf of up to 4.6 +/- 0.6 parts per thousand in S. wrightii and 3.0 +/- 0.6 parts per thousand in P. velutina were correlated with shifts in leaf sucrose concentration, but not with changes in d13C values of these respiratory substrates. Strong positive correlations between d13CR_root and root glucose d13C values in P. velutina suggest large diel changes in d13CR_root (were up to 3.9 parts per thousand) influenced by short-term changes in d13C of leaf-derived phloem C. No diel variation in d13CR_root was observed in S. wrightii. Our findings show that short-term changes in d13CR_leaf and d13CR_root were both related to substrate isotope composition and concentration. Changes in substrate limitation or demand for biosynthesis may largely control short-term variation in the d13C of respired CO2 in these species.","tags":null,"title":"Environmental and physiological controls on the carbon isotope composition of CO2 respired by leaves and roots of a C3 woody legume (Prosopis velutina) and a C4 perennial grass (Sporobolus wrightii)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["David A.

Here, we report the responses of two species with contrasting leaf characteristics and post-fire regeneration strategies (Cistus ladanifer L., malacophyllous, seeder; Erica arborea L., sclerophyllous, resprouter) to a manipulative field experiment that simulated a severe drought (45% reduction of historical average rainfall). We measured monthly changes in relative growth rate (RGR), specific leaf area (SLA), bulk leaf carbon isotope composition (delta C-13), predawn water potential (Psi(pd)), photosynthetic gas exchange, bulk modulus of elasticity and osmotic potential at maximum turgor (pi). Temporal (monthly) changes in RGR of C. ladanifer were correlated with all measured leaf traits (except pi) and followed Psi(pd) variation. However, the temporal pattern of RGR in E. arborea was largely unrelated to water availability. SLA monthly variation reflected RGR variation reasonably well in C. ladanifer, but not in E. arborea, in which shoot growth and delta C-13 increased at the time of maximum water stress in late summer. The relationship between water availability, and RGR and carbon assimilation in C. ladanifer, and the lack of any relationship in E. arborea suggest that the former has an enhanced capacity to harness unpredictable rainfall pulses compared with the latter. These contrasting responses to water availability indicate that the projected changes in rainfall with global warming could alter the competitive ability of these two species, and contribute to changes in plant dominance in Mediterranean shrublands.","tags":null,"title":"Differences in morpho-physiological leaf traits reflect the response of growth to drought in a seeder but not in a resprouter Mediterranean species","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Victor Resco de Dios","Jake F.

Prosopis velutina (velvet mesquite) has recently expanded on over 38 million ha in the grasslands of the American southwest. Mesquite establishment and expansion is potentially influenced by competitive interactions with grasses, particle size distribution (texture) of soil and changes in the amount and/or seasonality of precipitation, amongst other factors. To investigate the relative importance of precipitation seasonality, grass competition, and soil texture on mesquite seedling and establishment, we experimentally manipulated seasonality of precipitation across 72 1.5 m x 1.7 m plots that we planted with two grasses from contrasting functional groups (or left unvegetated) across two highly contrasting soil textures within a semi-desert grassland in Arizona, USA, wherein we followed the demography of 8640 planted mesquite seeds between 2002 and 2006. Up to 70% of the variance in seedling emergence was explained by soil water content, and seedling mortality was more dependent on summer than on winter precipitation. Mortality of less drought tolerant grasses after drought in coarse textured soils created conditions most favorable for seedling establishment, whereas lower rates of seedling establishment were observed in finer textured soils or in plots dominated by more drought tolerant grasses. We conclude that mesquite encroachment is episodic, based on discontinuous patterns of seedling establishment, favored on coarse textured soils and associated with unique conditions of high summer water availability when precipitation is not limiting and when competition from grasses is lowered.

Yet, the role of rainfall variability and its interaction with fire characteristics (e. g. fire season) on plant populations has received little attention. Here we investigated the changes in seedling emergence and recruitment of three seeder species (Cistus ladanifer, Erica umbellata and Rosmarinus officinalis) after fires lit during three different years and at two times (early and late) during the fire season. Three plots were burned at each season, for a total of 18 plots burned during the three years. After fire, emerged seedlings were tallied, tagged and monitored during three years (two in the last burning year). Rainfall during the study period was rather variable and, in some years, it was well below average. Postfire seedling emergence varied by a factor of 3 to 12, depending on the species and on the burning year. The bulk of seedling emergence occurred during the first year after fire; seedling recruitment at the end of the study period was tightly correlated with this early emergence. Emergence in Erica and Rosmarinus, but not in Cistus, was correlated with precipitation in the fall and winter immediately after fire, with Erica being the most sensitive to reduced rainfall. Fire season was generally neither an important factor in controlling emergence nor, in particular, recruitment. We discuss how projected changes in rainfall patterns with global warming could alter the balance of species in this shrubland, and could drive some species to near local extinction.","tags":null,"title":"Rainfall patterns after fire differentially affect the recruitment of three Mediterranean shrubs","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Victor Resco","Juan P.

A major research focus in population and community ecology is to establish a mechanistic understanding of plant interactions and demographic responses. The first step towards this mechanistic approach relies on understanding the differences in stress caused by different environmental conditions. Leaf-level photosynthetic rate (A) within and among plant populations provides important insight into population and community processes, but is difficult to acquire with sufficient replication under field conditions. Instead, chlorophyll fluorescence (F-v/F-m) and predawn water potential (Psi(pd)) are often used in arid and semi-arid ecosystems. 2. F-v/F-m reflects the photoactivation status of photosystem II (PSII), whereas Psi(pd) indicates water availability in the rhizosphere. Here we compare these indices with A in two perennial C-4 grasses (native Heteropogon contortus and invasive Eragrostis lehmanniana) and in seedlings of the C-3 shrub Prosopis velutina growing on highly contrasting sandy loam and loamy clay soils in experimental plots. Measurements were made the day prior to and up to 7 days following a 39-mm rainfall pulse after 2 months of drought. 3. A was more sensitive across a broad range of environmental conditions, whereas F-v/F-m and Psi(pd) only responded to periods of protracted drought. The use of these measures was further complicated because their values varied daily and we observed different time-lags in their response to precipitation pulses. 4. We suggest sampling schemes and a priori measurements to capture the value that is representative for the question of interest, and that match the pulsed biological activity in these ecosystems.

These results, together with those of CCA, suggest that light is the main factor directly affecting (with high levels of irradiance) and indirectly affecting (by changing volumetric soil water content) seedling demography and structure. Multiple regression analyses show that facilitation is the most important interaction affecting seedling growth, probably by reducing excess levels of irradiance. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Several species of cryptogams and invertebrates depend on deciduous trees, among which aspen (Populus tremula L.) is especially important. The occurrence and abundance of several terrestrial gastropod species are linked to aspen leaf litter. However, the impact of forestry practices on the gastropod communities is largely unknown. We examined difference in species richness, diversity (H'), and species composition in the gastropod fauna in aspen stands in a 400 km(2) managed boreal forest area in northern Sweden by collecting them with masonite boards from 20 selected stands. We contrasted isolated (500 m from the neighboring stand) and aggregated (","tags":null,"title":"Gastropod diversity in aspen stands in coastal northern Sweden","type":"publication"}]
